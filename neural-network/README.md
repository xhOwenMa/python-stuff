# Building a Neural Network in Python

a Jupyter Notebook of how to build a simple neural network, with ReLU, Softmax, and Categorical Cross Entropy Loss Function; this includes entensive (but simple) codes and explanations of various concepts

probably not going to finish the last parts, as partial derivatives (gradient) requires neater way to write math, and I do not think I want to do that in Jupyter notebook. Plus, all the main libraries all have autograd features, understanding the math intuitions behind them is enough

all the other main ideas should be covered for a simple neural network
