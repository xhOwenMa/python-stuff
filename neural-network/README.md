# Building a Neural Network in Python

a Jupyter Notebook of how to build a simple neural network, with ReLU, Softmax, and Categorical Cross Entropy Loss Function; this includes entensive (but simple) codes and explanations of various concepts

probably not going to finish the last parts, as back propagation requires neater way to write math, and I do not think I want to do that in Jupyter notebook

all the other main ideas should be covered for a simple neural network
