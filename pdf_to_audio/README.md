# Create audio of the pdf

make sure to install the packages; also only have one pdf (name it **book.pdf** so you don't have to change the code every time) in the directory

## known problem: 
- reader will only take a break when there are punctuations
- reader cannot read whole word if it is divided into two lines by hyphenation (this can be fixed by adding features to the reader and text editing step)

## thoughts
- the text extraction part can be easily modified for other useful purposes
